Here is the simple Linear regression code.

in ```data.csv``` we have data which contains two columns: mileage and the car price. The task is to fit linear regression so that given the mileage, we get the car price.  

The algorithm uses Mean Squared Error or Gradient Descent methods for solving the task. Pleae refer to *config.py* for additional parameters. 

```python train.py``` will create theta.txt. There are two numbers which are used for simple linear regression

```python predict.py``` 234.5  will predict car price for mileage 234.5
